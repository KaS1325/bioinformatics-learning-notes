# 📘 Bioinformatics Learning Notes: Stats, ML & AI Foundations

This repository documents my personal learning journey through the foundations of **statistics**, **machine learning**, and **AI** in the context of **bioinformatics**.

It is structured to reflect hands-on topics explored while taking the course _"AI, ML, and Deep Learning for Beginners in Bioinformatics"_, with additional independent reading and applied examples.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Build a **solid statistical foundation** for understanding biological data
- Apply concepts to real-world topics in **genomics**, **transcriptomics**, and **clinical diagnostics**
- Create a practical, reproducible reference for anyone starting out in computational biology or health data science

---

## 🧠 Key Topics Covered (and Growing)

- **Bayes’ Theorem** – Interpreting diagnostic test results
- **Probability Distributions** – Discrete & continuous, with emphasis on the normal distribution
- **Standard Deviation & Variance** – Applications in gene expression and clinical variation
- **Data Visualization** – Simple plots to interpret and explore biological data
- Upcoming:
  - Introduction to **Supervised Learning**
  - Basics of **Feature Selection** in biological datasets
  - Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
  - ML model evaluation: confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall
